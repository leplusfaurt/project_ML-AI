 ===== Machine Learning / AI & optimisation final project ===== 

 To do list : 

 -- REPORT PDF : explaining our choices

 -- Code : 
 - Add and try other classifer and clustering methods seen in labs
 - optimise features extractions to pick useful ones but avoiding overfitting and correlation
 - Use inscribed circles as submasks to extract the same features but on interest area (the circle)
   
 - anything that could improve the accuracy of the best model at the end of the code :)
